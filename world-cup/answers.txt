Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
with a small number of simulations like 10 and 100 it shows incorrect answers.
Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 1000 predictions.
